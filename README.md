## My process

### Built with

- React
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time I've used useContext in React. Being able to create and manage state accessible throughout the app without excessive prop drilling is a major milestone in improving the efficiency of my code.

Despite the ease of using libraries and additional frameworks I am often of the opinion that it is better to build everything from scratch. In line with that I have created all image carousels and pop ups myself as I find this a really good way to learn. 

### Continued development

I would like to combine a project of this scope with an API or even better, design and build my own back end to accompany this. I'd like to continue exploring useContext to include authentication and authorisation in addition to more adventurous features.
